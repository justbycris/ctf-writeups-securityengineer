# CTF Blog - Forbidden Paths in picoCTF

This CTF was fun and a good challenge. I started by doing some research path traversal. 
When I feel like I don't have enough knowledge on the context of my CTF lab, I always go into google and do some reasearch on the topic to make sure I'm on the right track. 

On this CTF challenge we have a simple pag with a form on its HTML that leads to different text files. By the description on the CTF we can tell we need to access the **flag.txt** file:

1. My first instinct was to change the file path of the form from **read.php** to **flag.txt** but nothing happened...:

2. In process...
